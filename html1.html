                If I get my own superpower then
                 I will think to have a magical healing power,
                  so that I could heal those who are sick and who 
                  are finding their magical love. They will tell 
                  me what is wrong with them and I would like that
                   to be the power to make everybody happy.
                    If they have any trouble they should be able
                    to solve it easily. I will make the whole world
                     stress free. They should face any problem 
                     with a smile.

                They could even transfer their disease to me
                , and they would eventually get well 
                and live a happy life. Because the foundation
        of good health is a happy and stress-free life. Health is indeed a divine gift to mankind. Health is wealth. He who has health, Has hope, has everything. Good health is one of the most precious jewels of our life. We seem to be living in a world marred by hectic schedules and busy routines with no time to spare even for ourselves. In our craze for securing happiness, we are moving away from it. Life has become so mechanized that it is taking its toll on our health and well-being.
         And the results are obvious. More and more people seem to be suffering from a host of health-related problems, courtesy of everyday stress, genetic disorders, 
         and acquired illnesses and acquired illnesses.
